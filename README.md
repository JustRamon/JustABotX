# JustABotX
Logs every channel it's in and allows you to request back every message logged!

## About
JustABotX is a bot that logs, and can take log requests.
Basic usage is like this:

**?clear**: Clears the log for the chan the command is executed in. (Only works for people whitelisted in ops.txt)

**?request [d/h/m] [int]**: Sends you the messages in the specified timeframe in a pm.

**?about**: Sends info about the bot.

**?help**: Sends you the help menu.

He'll also react on "\*lenny face\*" or any variation of that (with/without space and with higher case letters) by putting a real lenny face in chat.

##Exeptions
**JustABotX** will ignore logging messages with his own commands and EsperNet logon messages.
